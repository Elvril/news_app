## Features

### 1. Latest Articles by Category
The app showcases the most recent articles from multiple categories. This categorization helps users quickly find news relevant to their interests.

### 2. Dynamic Search Functionality
Users can perform keyword searches to find specific articles. The search results can be filtered by:
- **Date**: Pick a specific date using a date picker.
- **Popularity**: Sort articles by relevancy, popularity, or publication date.
- **Sources**: Filter articles by specific news sources.

### 3. Pagination Support
The app implements pagination to manage large sets of articles efficiently, allowing users to load more articles as they scroll through the list.

### 4. Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling ensures users receive informative feedback if API requests fail or if there are connectivity issues. This improves the overall user experience by providing clear guidance on any problems.

### 5. Offline Caching
Articles are stored locally using Hive, enabling users to access previously fetched articles without an internet connection. The app displays cached data while new articles are being loaded, preventing unnecessary reloads and enhancing performance.

### 6. Open Links Externally
With the help of the `url_launcher` package, users can easily open article links in their default web browser for an enriched reading experience.
